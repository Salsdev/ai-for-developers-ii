# ALX AI for Developers II - My Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my learning journey through the ALX AI for Developers II program. Here, I'll share my progress, hands-on projects, and insights as I deepen my understanding of AI-powered software development. This journey is focused on building real-world skills and preparing for a career in AI and software engineering.
## Tools I'll Be Using

Throughout this journey, I'll leverage a variety of tools to enhance my productivity and learning:

- **Trae** *(AI-native IDE)*: An AI-powered code editor designed to streamline development with intelligent features.
- **Cursor** *(AI-native IDE)*: My primary code editor, featuring built-in AI assistance for efficient development.
- **Gemini CLI**: To interact with Gemini models directly from the command line.
- **Gemini**: For advanced AI-powered assistance and experimentation.
- **ChatGPT**: As a conversational AI assistant for brainstorming, debugging, and learning.
- **Zed** *(AI-native IDE)*: A fast, collaborative code editor with integrated AI features.

Several of these tools, such as Trae, Cursor, and Zed, are AI-native IDEs, providing intelligent coding assistance and enhancing my workflow as I build, experiment, and document my progress in AI development.
